# Reinforcement Learning

This is a repo containing explanations and implementations of the following Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Note that, if you want to see the notebooks clearly (with LaTeX and stuff) you need to clone the repo.  

* ```git clone git@github.com:ceteke/RL.git```  
* ```cd RL```
* ```jupyter notebook```
